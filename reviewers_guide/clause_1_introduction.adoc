== Introduction

=== What is GeoPose?
Conceptually, when a real or digital objectâ€™s pose is defined relative to a geographical frame of reference it will be called a "geographically-anchored pose." All physical world objects inherently have a geographically-anchored pose. Digital objects may be associated with a geographically-anchored pose (for example, in a real-world overlay or on a stage).

Specifically, the OGC GeoPose Standard defines the rules for the interoperable interchange of geographically-anchored poses. As such, the OGC GeoPose Standard defines a conceptual model, a logical model, and encodings for the position and orientation of a real or a digital object in machine-readable forms using real world coordinates.

=== Why Is Another Standard Needed?
A new standard is required to facilitate the seamless interchange of position and orientation information between proprietary systems and any systems that implement to existing standards. The <<rg-landscape-standard-section, **review of standards related to GeoPose**>> demonstrates that there are many relevant specifications and standards that could use GeoPose, but do not, themselves, provide the elements and rules necessary to share poses.

=== How Does OGC GeoPose Address Diverse Requirements?
The https://data.ogc.org/geopose-swg/pdf/geopose_standard.pdf[**OGC GeoPose 1.0 standard**] defines data structures and rules for the interoperable exchange of the position and orientation (Poses) of real or virtual geometric objects within reference frames anchored to the Earth's surface (Geo).  In developing this standard, the SWG sought to use a single conceptual model to address requirements ranging from common use cases that benefit from low complexity and low optionality ("without optional parameters"), to those complex use cases needing more flexibility and extensibility.

In order to meet the wide range of requirements, the OGC GeoPose Standard specifies:

. Two basic forms with no configuration options for common use cases,
. An advanced form with more flexibility for more complex applications, and
. Five composite structures to support time series plus chain and graph structures.

OGC GeoPose 1.0 is the link:https://www.ogc.org/standards/specifications/list[OGC Implementation Standard] for exchanging GeoPoses.

=== How Was the OGC GeoPose v 1.0 Scope Defined?

While the Earth is the focus of the GeoPose 1.0, the standard could also be used in conjunction with astronomical bodies other than the Earth.

In the course of developing GeoPose v1.0, and in order to focus on the key objectives of the standard, the SWG members decided that the following considerations would be out of scope for the v1.0:

- Details of any frame transformations (e.g., the radius of the Earth),
- Differential properties (i.e., acceleration and velocity) and other physical properties of objects that could be associated with a GeoPose,
- Concepts of uncertainty (accuracy and precision),
- Camera models or view frustums,
- Scaling and other non-rigid transforms,
- Interpolation methods in case of complex targets.


While not in scope for GeoPose 1.0, any of the above could be presented in parallel with GeoPose. For example, many of the aspects which are excluded could be introduced as more properties in a schema.

=== Who Will Use the OGC Reviewers Guide?
The GeoPose Reviewers Guide is a resource for those who seek to understand key OGC GeoPose concepts used in OGC GeoPose, the requirements that the standard meets and the data structures the standard specifies.

The OGC intends this guide to be useful for reviewers of the standard as well as decision makers seeking to understand the relevance of this standard in their use cases.
