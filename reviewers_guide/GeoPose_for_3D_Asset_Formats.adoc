GeoPose for 3D asset Formats

The world of 3D asset formats is a bewildering mess that has been adding new formats to the list as new modelling and content creations applicationss and 3D content distribution platforms have appeared. This problem is generating a lot of wasted costs in the 3D asset pippelines as well as leaving lots of stakeholders frustrated. The need for standardization is apparent. Over time some notable initiatives and standardization efforts, such the Khronos Group's glTF format that already has wide adoption as well as their the recent "Real-time Asset Creation Guidelines" from their 3D E-commerce Working Group. The Open Source USD format published by Pixar has also recently seen a lot of adoption by major players in the industry. In the spatial computing industry and in particular for use-cases handling 3D assets with relation to the real world such as in real-world anchored AR, or 3d visualization, simulations or interactive representations of digital twins with known locations in the real world (from buildings to vehicles) there is to the knowledge of this working group not yet a standardized solution for encoding a real world pose of 3D assets. In the glTF standards working group it has been proposed to create a GeoPose extention to the gltTF format using the OGC GeoPose standard that this document presents to reviewers.

In this document we would like to point stakeholders who either work with or develop standards for 3D assets formats towards the opportunity of creating extensions to their formats that will comply with the OGC GeoPose encoding.
