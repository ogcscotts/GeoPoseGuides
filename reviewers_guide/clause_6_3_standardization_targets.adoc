=== Encodings for Implementation

The core of the OGC GeoPose Standard is the abstract frame transform. This is a representation of the transformation taking an outer frame coordinate system to an inner frame coordinate system. This abstraction is constrained in GeoPose v 1.0 to only allow transformations involving translation and rotation. The intention is to match the usual concept of a pose as a position and orientation. The formalism that expresses a GeoPose frame transform is a pair of reference frames, outer and inner, each defined by a frame specification.

Conformant implementation of the Standard (position and orientation) is accomplished by implementing one or more of the eight conformance classes. The requirements for each conformance class are documented in eight requirements classes. Each requirements class has a one-to-one correspondence with one of the eight standardization targets defined in the Standard.

Core:

* The two Basic GeoPose targets are simple and concise â€“ no options. They satisfy most use case requirements and assume a local tangent plane ENU frame derived from WGS84.
* An Advanced GeoPose target supports more complex use cases where the outer geographic reference frame is not LTP-ENU and/or a valid time is needed.

Composite:

* The Chain GeoPose target provides additional flexibility with multiple intermediate frames or specific coordinate reference systems as needed.
* The Frame Graph target supports the full structure need to represent networks of reference frames that arise with the use of multiple and linked location technologies.
* The three (Time) Sequence targets support the packaging of fixed-length time series of GeoPoses and the payload data objects for open-ended GeoPose streams.


Depending on the use case and requirements, a developer can implement support for one or more of these targets.

There are automated tests that can be used to determine whether an actual JSON-encoded GeoPose data object conforms to the Standard.

In the majority of use cases, requirements are met by using either:

* *Basic-YPR* GeoPose encoding when orientation is defined by yaw, pitch, and roll angles

* *Basic-Quaternion* GeoPose encoding when orientation is defined by a unit quaternion

There are two versions of Basic GeoPose since some developers prefer a human-readable encoding. In these cases, the Basic-YPR is chosen, in which the orientations are stored as angles. In general, orientation as quaternions in the Basic-Quaternion version is preferred and leads to less complex code.

The two differences between Basic GeoPose and Advanced GeoPose is that, first, in Advanced GeoPose, the developer can specify an outer geographic reference frame other than LTP-ENU. In addition, in the Advanced GeoPose encoding, a single time stamp can be provided. The time stamp pertains only to the single encoding so one of the Composite GeoPose encodings is not needed.

The three Composite GeoPose encodings are designed for when there are linked and sequential GeoPoses. The Chain GeoPose is a linear set of linked poses. The Graph GeoPose is used when there are linked poses but not necessarily in a linear sequence.

For time series poses with constant time spacing, the developer will choose to use the Regular Timeseries GeoPose encoding. When there is a per-GeoPose time stamp that is not at a regular interval, the developer will choose to use the Irregular Timeseries GeoPose encoding. Finally, in use cases that do not have a pre-defined end time (also referred to as an open-ended sequence of time-stamped GeoPoses), the developer will specify the Stream GeoPose encoding.
