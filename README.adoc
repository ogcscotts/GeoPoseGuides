# GeoPoseGuides

In this repo, members of the OGC GeoPose SWG are developing the GeoPose reviewers and users guides.

The GeoPose Reviewers Guide will provide engineering guidance, including explanations of key concepts, to professionals who, for the purpose of providing detailed feedback and input to the SWG, seek to understand:

. the technical underpinnings and goals of GeoPose and,
. the landscape of options which currently exist as alternatives or adjacent to the GeoPose standard.

The GeoPose Users Guide will provide engineering guidance, including explanations of key concepts, to users who will develop and work directly with GeoPose-enabled products and services.

For this guide, the term "users" will mean people with software engineering skills from highly diverse backgrounds, including but not limited to:

. Implementers seeking to understand use of GeoPose and to include/integrate GeoPose in their diverse products and services,
. Scientists and other R&D professionals who will use GeoPose for their projects,
. Data miners that will use GeoPose to filter data sets, and
. Data publishers who will include GeoPose in their offerings.

If you wish to contribute to the guides, or have recommendations and questions, please create an issue in this relevant repo.

## Requirements

To compile the AsciiDoctor (*.adoc) files to HTML and PDF files, it is required to install the Ruby language form its website (https://www.ruby-lang.org/).

AsciiDoctor can be installed as a Gem using the following command:

	gem install asciidoctor

To be able to generate the PDF files, the asciidoctor-pdf gem is also required:

	gem install asciidoctor-pdf

## Building Process

To generate the Reviewers Guide HTML (updating the image links and applying a CSS style):
    asciidoctor -o GeoPose-Reviewers-Guide.html -a imagesdir=reviewers_guide/images -a stylesheet=styles/GeoPose-theme.css reviewers_guide/GeoPose-Reviewers-Guide.adoc  

To generate the Reviewers Guide PDF (applying the custom theme):
    asciidoctor-pdf --trace -a pdf-style=reviewers_guide/styles/GeoPose-theme.yml -o ./GeoPose-Reviewers-Guide.pdf reviewers_guide/GeoPose-Reviewers-Guide.adoc
